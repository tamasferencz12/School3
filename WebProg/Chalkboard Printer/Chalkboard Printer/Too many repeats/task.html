<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Since we have dynamic input from the user, let's add the ability to log more messages on the console. In this stage, you'll take input for the number of times the message will repeat. After that, you will use the input to repeat the messages.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Follow the output style given in the examples.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>You should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the variables from the previous stages.</li>
<li>Take the input for the number of repeats.</li>
<li>Log this message to the console using the number of repeats times: <code class="java">This is [name] [surname] and [message]</code></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

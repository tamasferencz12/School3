<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In the show's intro, Bart Simpson is tasked with writing a message multiple times on a chalkboard as a punishment. Too bad he didn't know programming for this task. Luckily, you know how to create a JavaScript program to do this.</p>

<p>Like Bart Simpson, you must create a JavaScript program to log a message to the console multiple times.</p>
<p>In this stage, you will notice we've declared the variables you need to use. However, we've made a mistake. Correct the error, assign the necessary values from the objectives section, and log the message five times.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Make sure to follow the output style given in the examples.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>You should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Declare a variable named <code class="java">name</code> and assign the value <code class="java">Bart</code> to it.</li>
<li>Declare a variable named <code class="java">surname</code> and assign the value <code class="java">Simpson</code> to it.</li>
<li>Declare a variable named <code class="java">message</code> and assign the value <code class="java">I will not skateboard in the halls.</code> to it.</li>
<li>Log this message to the console using the variables above five times: <code class="java">This is [name] [surname] and [message]</code></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is Bart Simpson and I will not skateboard in the halls.
This is Bart Simpson and I will not skateboard in the halls.
This is Bart Simpson and I will not skateboard in the halls.
This is Bart Simpson and I will not skateboard in the halls.
This is Bart Simpson and I will not skateboard in the halls.
</code></pre>

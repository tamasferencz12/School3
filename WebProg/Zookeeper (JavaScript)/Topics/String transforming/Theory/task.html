<p>You already know what strings are and how to use them. But what you haven't been shown yet is how to <strong>transform</strong> a string. Operations like dividing it into several pieces, converting its letters to upper or lowercase, and more. In this topic, you will learn about the methods used to perform these important tasks.</p><h5 id="changing-the-case">Changing the case</h5><p>The first two methods on the list are <code class="language-javascript">toUpperCase()</code> and <code class="language-javascript">toLowerCase()</code>. As their names suggest, they allow you to convert all the letters within a string to either upper or lowercase. This often comes in handy. For example, you might want to change a DOM element's content to match the lowercase text used in the rest of a page.</p><p>Both methods are called in the way you would expect:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let mystring = 'HYPERSKILL';
console.log(mystring.toLowerCase()); // hyperskill

mystring = 'hyperskill';
console.log(mystring.toUpperCase()); // HYPERSKILL
</code></pre><p>These methods don't accept any other arguments and do not<strong> </strong>change the value of the initial variable. Instead, they return a new transformed version of the string that you can either save into a variable or log to the console.</p><h5 id="removing-extra-spaces">Removing extra spaces</h5><p>Users typically don't care if there are extra spaces around their email addresses when they're entering them to create an account — they expect your website to <strong>trim</strong> them out automatically. The same applies to all form fields and in many other scenarios. So, the responsibility for removing extra space at the beginning and end of any user-supplied text rests on your shoulders.</p><p>To perform this task, you could run a loop that removes the first item from the string while it's equal to the space character (<code class="language-javascript">' '</code>). Then you could run another loop to remove the spaces at the end. However, a better alternative is to use the <code class="language-javascript">trim()</code> method, which allows you to achieve the same result with a single line of code:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let user_email = '    hyperskill@gmail.com        ';
console.log(user_email.trim()); // hyperskill@gmail.com</code></pre><p>As with the methods in the previous section, it's important to keep in mind that <code class="language-javascript">trim()</code> doesn't change the original string. This means that if you execute the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let user_email = '    hyperskill@gmail.com        ';
user_email.trim();
console.log(user_email); //     hyperskill@gmail.com        </code></pre><p>You'll still see a string with extra spaces.</p><h5 id="repeating-a-string">Repeating a string</h5><p>There are times when it can be useful to generate a new string by <strong>repeating</strong> an original string several times. You can do this with a for loop that concatenates two strings together repeatedly:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let mystring = 'text ';
let result = '';

for(let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    result = result + mystring;
}

console.log(result); // text text text text text </code></pre><p>The above may not look very complicated, but why use so many lines of code when JavaScript has a tool designed specifically for the job? The simplest way to achieve this goal is by using the <code class="language-javascript">repeat()</code> method, as shown below:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let mystring = 'text ';
let result = mystring.repeat(5);
console.log(result); // text text text text text </code></pre><p>It's as easy as that! Remember that this method doesn't change the initial string either — it returns a transformed string that you can save to a variable or log to the console.</p><h5 id="finding-a-substring">Finding a substring</h5><p>Sometimes you receive a really long string and need to cut it into pieces so you can extract the parts that make sense. So how can this processing be done? Well, provided you know the indices of each of the <strong>substrings</strong> you require, the <code class="language-javascript">substring()</code> method can help. It accepts two arguments — the index numbers of the first and last symbols that form the substring. Under the hood, it extracts all the characters between the index positions and returns a new string. Here's a quick example:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let mystring = 'Sample text';
console.log(mystring.substring(0, 6)); // Sample
</code></pre><p>Notice that the letter in the last index position is not included in the range. That's why the index numbers <code class="language-javascript">0</code> and <code class="language-javascript">6</code> are specified in the above example, instead of <code class="language-javascript">0</code> and <code class="language-javascript">5</code>. You can see what happens if you don't take this into account below:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let mystring = 'Sample text';
console.log(mystring.substring(0, 5)); // Sampl
</code></pre><p>You can also pass <code class="language-javascript">substring()</code> a single argument. If you take this approach, the method will return a substring from the starting position until the end of the string:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let mystring = 'Sample text';
console.log(mystring.substring(3)); // ple text</code></pre><p>Some other points that you need to consider when using this method are listed below:</p><ul><li><p>If the first argument has a higher value than the second, JavaScript automatically switches them.</p></li><li><p>If either argument is less than or equal to <code class="language-javascript">0</code>, or if a <code class="language-javascript">NaN</code> value is used, it's treated as <code class="language-javascript">0</code>.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, if either argument is greater than the length of the string, it's considered equal to the length of the string.</p></li></ul><p>You may also encounter a similar method called <code class="language-javascript">substr()</code>. Like <code class="language-javascript">substring()</code>, this method takes two arguments (and the second one is optional as well). However, while the first argument is still the index where the substring begins, the second is the <strong>length</strong> of the required substring instead of the end position:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let mystring = 'Sample text';
console.log(mystring.substr(3, 5)); // ple t</code></pre><p>Be aware that the <code class="language-javascript">substr()</code> method is <strong>deprecated </strong>though some browsers might still support it. So you should avoid using it if possible.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>In this topic, you have discovered more about the power of strings. You've learned how to transform them by using some of the most common string methods, and that this only requires a single line of code. You now know how to change a string's letters to upper or lowercase, trim away unnecessary space, repeat a string multiple times, and extract substrings. Enjoy!</p>

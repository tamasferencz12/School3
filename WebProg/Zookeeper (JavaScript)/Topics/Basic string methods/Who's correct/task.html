<p>Michael and Jordan have an argument. Both of them have different perspectives on the single method in JavaScript. Michael says that the <code class="java">split()</code> method returns a new string whereas Jordan argues that the <code class="java">split()</code> method returns an array that contains strings as the array's elements. Can you help them figure out who is correct?</p>
